    Keep the dashboard off PUBLIC networks.

        powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\firewall-private-only.ps1 -Remove

    Run from an ADMINISTRATOR PowerShell: firewall rules need elevation.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    WHY

    `next start` listens on every interface, on purpose: the phone posts to
    it over the home Wi-Fi. But Windows' first-run prompt for node.exe
    typically ends with node allowed on BOTH Private and Public profiles, for
    any port. So a laptop that joins cafe or hotel Wi-Fi offers the login form
    to everyone on that network -- and the password travels in cleartext,
    because this is plain HTTP.

    This adds ONE inbound BLOCK rule for the dashboard's port on the Public
    profile. Windows Firewall evaluates block rules before allow rules, so it
    wins over node.exe's blanket allow without touching that rule, and it
    leaves every other node program alone.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    !! YOUR HOME NETWORK MUST BE "PRIVATE" FIRST, or the phone is cut off.

    Windows files many home networks as Public by default. The script checks
    the networks you are connected to right now and REFUSES if any is Public,
    because blocking then would silently stop the phone's syncs -- and the
    phone would only show it as a connection error in its own status line.

    To fix: Settings > Network & internet > Wi-Fi (or Ethernet) > your
    network > Network profile type > Private. Then run this again. Use
    -Force only if you really mean to block on the network you are on.

    Keep this file pure ASCII. See CLAUDE.md.
