/**
 * The periodic upload.
 *
 * JobScheduler rather than WorkManager: it is framework, so the app has no
 * dependencies at all, and it already does the two things needed -- run on a
 * schedule, only on an unmetered network, and survive a reboot.
 *
 * **Cadence has a much thinner margin than the sibling project's.** That app
 * had ~90 days of network history to play with; screen time has TEN days of
 * per-day resolution (measured: 10 daily files), and an event reach that
 * Phase 1 could not determine at all -- dumpsys showed 24h, but that is the
 * dump's limit rather than the API's, so the app measures it on device and
 * reports it with every sync.
 *
 * Six hours is comfortable against ten days and possibly tight against one.
 * The rule is unchanged -- collect faster than eviction, not faster than
 * writing -- but here it is worth re-checking against the reach shown on the
 * dashboard rather than assuming.
