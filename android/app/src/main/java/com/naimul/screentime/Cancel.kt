/**
 * A stop signal for one sync, set by [SyncJobService.onStopJob].
 *
 * JobScheduler stops a job when its constraints lapse -- the unmetered
 * network went away -- or its time is up, and expects the work to stop with
 * it. Returning from onStopJob did not do that: the thread went on reading
 * and then uploading on whatever network it now had. The sync checks this
 * between the read and the upload, and an upload in flight is disconnected,
 * which fails it before the watermark moves; the next sync sends the same
 * window again, which the server's MAX() upsert makes harmless.
