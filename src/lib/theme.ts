/**
 * Light and dark themes.
 *
 * The theme is `data-theme` on <html>, `'light'` or `'dark'`. Every colour in
 * the stylesheet and the accent layer (lib/accent.ts) is a custom property
 * with a value per theme, so that one attribute repaints the whole page --
 * charts included, since they paint with `var()` too.
 *
 * The CHOICE is 'dark', 'light' or 'system', kept per browser in
 * localStorage. It is a viewing preference, not part of the history, so it
 * does not belong in the database: two browsers may well want different
 * themes. Dark is the default because it is what this dashboard has always
 * been; 'system' follows the OS and keeps following it.
 *
 * It is applied by `THEME_SCRIPT`, inlined at the top of <head>, BEFORE first
 * paint -- a stylesheet or an effect would paint one frame of the wrong theme
 * on every navigation that reloads the page. The same script is what the
 * toggle calls after a change, so there is exactly one implementation.
 *
 * Ported from the sibling Data Usage Tracker, 2026-10-01. The key differs
 * (`st-theme`, not `du-theme`) although localStorage is partitioned by port
 * anyway -- for the same reason the sidebar key is namespaced: the human
 * reading DevTools.
